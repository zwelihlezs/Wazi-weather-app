Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document
Weather App
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Weather App aims to provide users with real-time weather updates, forecasts, and severe weather alerts. The app will be built using React Native and will integrate third-party weather APIs to deliver accurate weather data to users on iOS and Android platforms.
1.2 Document Overview
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, and implementation plan for the Weather App.
1.3 Scope
* Provide real-time weather updates based on the user’s location.
* Display hourly & weekly forecasts.
* Send severe weather alerts for storms, extreme heat, or heavy rainfall.
* Support multiple locations for users to check the weather in different places.
* Allow users to set weather notifications.
* Implement dark mode for better user experience.
* Deploy on iOS & Android platforms.
1.4 Stakeholders
* End Users: Individuals using the app for weather updates.
* Developers: Software engineers responsible for coding and maintaining the app.
* Product Owners: Decision-makers ensuring the app aligns with business goals.
* Third-Party API Providers: Services providing real-time weather data.

4. System Architecture
4.1 High-Level Architecture
The system consists of the following components:
* Frontend: React Native (UI for Android & iOS).
* Backend: Node.js & Express.js (Handles API requests & push notifications).
* Database: Firebase Firestore (Stores user preferences & location data).
* Weather API: OpenWeatherMap / WeatherAPI (Provides real-time data).
4.2 Data Flow
1. The user opens the app, which requests location permissions.
2. The frontend sends a request to the backend with the user’s location.
3. The backend fetches weather data from the Weather API.
4. The backend processes and sends data back to the frontend.
5. The app displays weather conditions, forecasts, and alerts to the user.
6. If severe weather is detected, the app sends push notifications.
________________


5. User Interface Design
The UI will include:
* Home Screen: Displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and location.
* Forecast Screen: Shows hourly and 7-day weather predictions.
* Settings: Allows users to set notification preferences and select temperature units.
________________


6. Constraints & Assumptions
* The app requires an active internet connection for real-time weather updates.
* GPS permissions must be granted to fetch location-based data.
* The app should work in low-bandwidth conditions (data caching).
________________


7. Deployment & Maintenance
7.1 Deployment Plan
* Deploy backend services on AWS Lambda for scalability.
* Publish app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
7.2 Maintenance Plan
* Regular API updates to ensure accurate data.
* Bug fixes and performance improvements every two weeks.
* Monitor user feedback and implement feature requests.
________________


8. Future Enhancements
* AI-based weather predictions for more accurate forecasts.
* Voice command integration (e.g., "Hey, what's the weather today?").
* Offline mode for checking previously fetched weather data.
* Wearable device support (e.g., Smartwatches).
