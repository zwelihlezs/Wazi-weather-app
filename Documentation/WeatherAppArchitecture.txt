1. High-Level Architecture
The app will follow a three-layer architecture to separate concerns and ensure scalability:
1. Presentation Layer (Frontend):

   * Built using React Native for cross-platform support.
   * Manages the user interface (UI) and handles user interactions.
   * Responsible for making API calls to fetch data and presenting it to the user.
   2. Business Logic Layer (Middleware):

      * Processes requests and responses between the frontend and backend.
      * Handles caching (e.g., previously fetched weather data for offline mode).
      * Manages state (e.g., user preferences, favorite locations) using Redux or Context API.
      3. Data Layer (Backend and APIs):

         * Integrates with third-party weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
         * Handles notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging for weather alerts).
         * Optional: Stores user preferences and analytics data in a database.

2. System Components
a. Frontend Components (React Native)
         * Screens:

            * Home Screen: Displays real-time weather information for the user’s current location.
            * Search Screen: Allows users to search for weather in specific cities or locations.
            * Favorites Screen: Lists saved locations with their respective weather updates.
            * Settings Screen: Enables users to customize preferences (e.g., temperature units, notification settings, etc.).
            * Reusable Components:

               * WeatherCard: Displays weather information (e.g., temperature, condition, icon).
               * LocationPicker: Allows users to search for or select a location.
               * AlertBanner: Displays weather alerts or warnings.
               * State Management:

                  * Use Redux or React Context API for managing global app state (e.g., user preferences, favorite locations).
                  * Navigation:

                     * Use React Navigation to implement navigation between screens (Stack Navigator for screens and Tab Navigator for bottom navigation).
________________


b. Backend Components
The backend may or may not be needed, depending on app complexity. If included:
                     * Authentication Service (Optional):

                        * Authenticate users via social login (e.g., Firebase Authentication or OAuth).
                        * Weather API Integration:

                           * Connect to a third-party weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack) for real-time data.
                           * Push Notifications:

                              * Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications to users about weather alerts.
                              * Database (Optional):

                                 * Store user preferences, favorite locations, and cached weather data in a lightweight cloud database like Firebase Firestore.

3. Data Flow Diagram
Here is the flow of data between the app’s components:
                                 1. Frontend User Interaction:

                                    * The user interacts with the app by searching for a location, saving preferences, or enabling notifications.
                                    * The app sends API requests to fetch weather data or update settings.
                                    2. Backend/API Request:

                                       * The app sends requests to the third-party weather API for data.
                                       * The backend processes and forwards the request (if used).
                                       * The weather API responds with JSON data containing weather details.
                                       3. Data Handling in the App:

                                          * The app parses the API response.
                                          * Updates the UI by displaying real-time weather data.
                                          * Stores user preferences locally or in the cloud (if implemented).
                                          4. Push Notifications:

                                             * The backend sends severe weather alerts to the user’s device via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

4. UI/UX Design
The UI design should ensure simplicity and usability, focusing on a clean and visually appealing layout.
a. Design Principles
                                             * Follow Material Design guidelines for Android.
                                             * Follow Human Interface Guidelines for iOS.
                                             * Ensure cross-platform consistency.

6. High-Level Diagram
Here’s a breakdown of the system architecture:
                                                         1. Frontend (React Native):
